# React Music Dashboard

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - using React. 

You donâ€™t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.



### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```yarn create react-app my-app``` - this enabled the creation of the React application using Yarn.

```yarn starrt``` - Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

```yarn test``` - Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests).

```yarn build``` - Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Once done, the dashboard is ready to be deployed.
